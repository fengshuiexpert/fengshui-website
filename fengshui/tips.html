                <p>Get expert Feng Shui consulting from Frances He, Ph.D., one of the top practitioners in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

                <p>Combining classical Chinese Feng Shui knowledge with her U.S. training as a psychologist, she will work with you to adjust the energy flow in your home or office to create a "good" Feng Shui environment that will promote health, happiness and prosperity.</p>

                <p>Frances offers the following simple <strong>Feng Shui tips</strong> for you:</p>

                <h2>Feng Shui Tips</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>To reduce stagnant Chi, get rid of the "stuff" you no longer use in the house</li>

                    <li>To bring in good opportunities, keep your front entrance clean and free of obstacles</li>

                    <li>To attract good Chi, take care of your plants both inside and outside your house</li>

                    <li>To cultivate more harmony in your relationship, place fresh-cut flowers in your bedroom</li>

                    <li>To disperse negative Chi from the streets and your surroundings, hang a wind chime outside your front entrance</li>

                    <li>To increase your prosperity, place a mirror behind the stove to double the burners which are symbols of wealth</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These tips will give you an idea of how a Feng Shui practitioner will adjust your environment to achieve your objectives. An expert practitioner goes beyond these simple remedies to &ldquo;read&rdquo; your entire surroundings and identify interventions that are unique to your personality and appropriate for your destiny.</p>

                <p>Read on to understand more about Feng Shui and how it works.</p>

                <h2>What is the objective of Feng Shui?</h2>

                <p>In simple terms, Feng Shui works to create a harmonious and Yin-Yan balanced flow of Chi in your living space. For example, excessive active energy (Yan energy) in the house might cause irritation and argument in the household. Excessive stationary energy (Yin energy) might cause depression and even suppress the occupants' luck.</p>

                <p>An expert practitioner can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the ebb and flow of Chi in your surroundings and find ways to strengthen and channel it for your benefit.</p>

                <h3>What is the Ba-Gua?</h3>

                <p>The Ba-Gua is the "compass" or map that is superimposed on your property and your house to help you locate areas on your property or in your house for career, helpful people, children, creativity, marriage, recognition, financial success, family, knowledge and self-enlightenment. Feng Shui problems reflect issues in the occupants' lives. For example, in a home where the marriage area is missing or has blocking energy, the occupant may have a difficult time in a relationship or may not have a relationship.</p>

                <p>An expert practitioner creates a Ba-Gua that you can use as a guide to to develop awareness of the significance of your surroundings. It is the foundation for applying Feng Shui remedies that are appropriate to your objectives.</p>

                <h3>Some examples of Feng Shui remedies</h3>

                <p>Remedies such as crystals, mirrors or bamboo flutes are called transcendental cures (non-logical, non-scientific cures). Though they may seem "magical," they serve as a display to remind you to cultivate good intentions for your goals in the area on which you are working.</p>

                <p>In Frances's own words:</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I remind my clients not to just use transcendental cures, but also apply mundane cures (logical, scientific cures). Here is a story to illustrate my point.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;One of my clients, Jennifer, applied transcendental cures to form a good relationship. She planted pink roses at the marriage corner in her back yard next to the compost pile. At the same time, with my encouragement, she used mundane cures, starting with networking. She called her friends in her address book and told them she was available for a relationship. A month and a half later, much to my surprise, because of the short time period, she called me to set up an another appointment to Feng Shui her new boyfriend's home because she was going to move in with him.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Feng Shui remedies, both transcendental and mundane, are a way to follow up a Feng Shui appointment with cues and activities that initiate the changes you want in your life.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I invite you to experience the benefits of a Feng Shui appointment.&rdquo;</p>
