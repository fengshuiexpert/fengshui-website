                <h2>Frances He, Ph.D.</h2>

                <p>Dr. Frances He is one of the <strong>top Feng Shui practitioners</strong> in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

                <h3>Trained in Classical Chinese Feng Shui</h3>

                <p>Frances was <strong>born and educated in Canton, China</strong>. She inherits her skills from a long lineage of traditional Chinese Feng Shui masters. Her training began at the age of five when her grandfather decided it was time to introduce her to the art of Feng Shui. What he imparted to her was a wisdom and knowledge that takes a lifetime to master.</p>

                <p>After emigrating to the United States as a youth, she honored her grandfather's wishes and <strong>studied Feng Shui with a number of Chinese teachers</strong> resident or traveling to the U.S., most notably the <strong>esteemed Professor Lin Yun</strong>. As a bicultural expert, <strong>fluent in English as well as Cantonese and Mandarin</strong>, Dr. He is uniquely able to translate the concepts and analysis of classical Chinese Feng Shui for American clients.</p>

                <h3>U.S. Doctorate in Psychology</h3>

                <p>Frances has been fortunate to receive the full benefit of a U.S. education to complement the knowledge of her own heritage. She received her <strong>B.A degree from U.C. Berkeley</strong> (in Computer Science) and then entered graduate school in psychology. Fulfilling her personal dream, she obtained her <strong>Ph.D. in psychology from John F. Kennedy University</strong>. She maintains a busy practice in San Francisco and Berkeley as a licensed psychotherapist. Her Feng Shui practice is a way to offer the knowledge of her ancestors in a form that is popular among American clients.</p>

                <h3>Feng Shui Consulting</h3>

                <p>Dr. He provides Feng Shui consulting for clients' residences, retail shops, and business offices. She has developed a specialty practice for clients in Chiropractic and Law. She is <strong>available for onsite appointments throughout the San Francisco Bay Area</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Feng Shui Teaching</h3>

                <p>Dr. He has honored the legacy of her ancestors by introducing Feng Shui to students through classes, as well as engaging in outreach to other professions and the general public. Among other engagements, Dr. He has been honored to address the faculty at U.C. San Francisco and designers at American Institute of Architects (AIA).</p>

                <h3>In Her Own Words</h3>

                <p>&ldquo;It has been satisfying and rewarding work, especially when clients call to share their Feng Shui success stories and express their appreciation!&rdquo;</p>
