					<p>Get <strong>expert Fung Shu (Feng Shui) consulting</strong> from Frances He, Ph.D., one of the top practitioners in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>								
					<p>Frances believes that the unfavorable Feng Shui in houses or offices is a metaphor for occupants' issues in their lives. Combining classical Chinese Feng Shui knowledge with her U.S. training as a psychologist, she will work with you to adjust the energy flow in your home or office to create a "good" Feng Shui environment that will promote health, happiness and prosperity. </p>
					<p>Note: &ldquo;Feng Shui&rdquo; is the recommended spelling in English.</p>
					<h2>What is Fung Shu (Feng Shui)?</h2>
					<p>Literally it means wind and water.  It is the ancient Chinese art of positioning buildings and furniture to create a harmonious flow of Chi (energy) to support our well being (promote health, wealth and happiness).</p>
					<h2>What takes place during a Fung Shu (Feng Shui) consultation?</h2>
					<p>In Frances's own words:</p>
					<p>&ldquo;I come to my clients' homes, offices or shops to conduct a consultation.  It involves the following steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>&ldquo;I have my clients clarify their objectives for the consultation. For example, the most common objectives are creating harmonious energy, attracting abundance in life, cultivating healthy relationships and careers.</li>
						<li>&ldquo;Then I Feng Shui the energy outside of the home. I see if the neighborhood buildings, roads or objects create negative energy towards the house or office.  </li>
						<li>&ldquo;I move on to Feng Shui the interior of the house or office, keeping the client's objectives in mind so that I don't have to work on every Feng Shui issue in the house.</li>
						<li>&ldquo;During the consultation, I educate my clients on how to identify good Chi and bad Chi, and I work with them to find personalized Feng Shui remedies that resonate with their energy to balance the undesirable Chi inside and outside the house. </li>
						<li>&ldquo;At the end I give follow-up instructions to my clients.&rdquo;</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h2>What have people experienced after a Fung Shu (Feng Shui) adjustment?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Felt calm, serene  and peaceful with a good flow of Chi in the house or office</li>
						<li>Improved  productivity  </li>
						<li>Moved to a different place</li>
						<li>Got a new job </li>
						<li>Got involved in a relationship</li>
						<li>Tripled sales</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Psychological benefits of Fung Shu (Feng Shui)</h2>
					<p>Frances combines her experience as a practicing Bay Area psychotherapist with her family's traditional Chinese knowledge of Feng Shui. Though Feng Shui is not a substitute for psychotherapy for those in crisis, Frances believes Feng Shui can serve as catalyst to self-growth. In Frances's own words:</p>
					<p>&ldquo;It brings change to your life.  It forces you to examine issues hidden in your subconscious mind, which you avoided confronting in the past.&rdquo;</p>
